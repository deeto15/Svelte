	<h1>About my Project</h1>

	<p>
		I started this website as a class project for Distributed Web Systems Design. You can create your own by clicking the links on the right or left sides of the header.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our assignment is to create a working website. I did not feel like creating an entire website from scratch using raw HTML, so I decided to use a skeleton project as recommended by my Professor.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can use the Sverdle page to play a ripoff of Scrabble. It is fun but also shows how the website is interactive. I will probably be changing that later on to do something else so that my project differs from the original Svelte clone.
	</p>

	<p>
		I will be adding and updating features as time goes on. This is just the beginning!
